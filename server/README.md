# Server

The server is written in go (aka golang) so you need to install go and set up your development environment (paths, IDE, etc.)

# Setup development environment

## 1. Requirements

* Installed and working go compiler (s. `go.mod` for required minimum version)
* For the database do **one** of the following: 
    * Install and setup docker daemon (for the PostgreSQL database; setup is described later)
    * Directly install and setup PostgreSQL server (9.6 and newer should work)
* And of course an working IDE setup of your choice (I can recommend *GoLand* as fancy-pants, *LiteIDE* as pure open-source and of course *vim* as hard-core IDE)

## 2. Dependencies

**tl;dr:**
* If you use go version < 1.12 : the whole go module stuff doesn't work for you, so make sure the packages listed below are installed
* If you use go version >= 1.12 : nothing to do here

This project uses the **go module** infrastructure, so e.g. `go build` installs all dependencies for you.
The frameworks/libraries this project uses are there in order to make the development easier:

* [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) to easily create simple rest endpoints
* [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) for server â†’ client communication
* [x/oauth2](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2) for the OAuth2 authentication
* [lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) for a postgres database driver
* [pkg/errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) better error handling and enables us to show stack traces
* [hauke96/sigolo](https://github.com/hauke96/sigolo) for logging
* [alecthomas/kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong) for cli parameter and flag parsing

## 3. Setup the Database

The server requires a database called `stm` with the required tables as described below.
This description assumes that you use docker instead of an direct installation of PostgreSQL.

### Set Database user/password as environment variable

**tl;dr:**
* `export STM_DB_USERNAME=stm STM_DB_PASSWORD=secret STM_DB_HOST=localhost`
* **or** Set the database entries in a custom JSON-config and use that file with the `-c`/`--config` parameter. 

You can override the default DB username, password (`stm` and `secret`) and host by setting environment variables.
To make this permanent, you probably want to add this to the `.bachrc` or similar files.

### Start as docker container

**tl;dr:**
* `docker-compose up --build stm-db`

The `docker-compose.yml` defines such container, just execute `docker-compose up --build stm-db` to start it.
**Notice: ** This just starts the database server, the database tables are created in the next step.

### Initialize database 

**tl;dr:**
* Make sure `psql` is installed
* start database (if not already running)
* `cd server/database/`
* `./init-db.sh`

The folder `server/database/` contains the script `init-db.sh`.
Start your database and call this script (from within that folder).

You need the tools `createdb` and `psql`. Both are - for ubuntu users - available in the package `postgresql-client`.

### Reset database

**tl;dr:**
* `psql -h localhost -U postgres -c 'DROP DATABASE stm;'`
* `cd server/database`
* `./init-db.sh`

This is just needed if you want to get rid of the current data (e.g. after testing).

## 4. Setup the Login

There are two approaches:

1. OSM dev-API with a real account
2. Local fake-Server emulating the OSM API

### With OSM dev-API

The default config of the server uses the [development API of OSM](https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org).
So you need to have an account there and also need to register your local application the to get the OAuth credentials.

#### OSM OAuth credentials

To perform a login (even a login of your locally running application), you'll need OAuth credentials (so the OAuth2 client-ID and -secret).
You can set these with environment variables:

* `export STM_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="Eln7...rY66"`
* `export STM_OAUTH2_SECRET="fgg1...kl09"`

You can export these variables each time you start a new terminal or just put it into a file of your choice (e.g. `.bashrc`) to load then e.g. after your system booted.

You can also create your own JSON-config file and set everything there.

## 5. Setup finished :)

Now you can start database, server (s. below) and the client (s. [README](../../client) in the `client` folder) and access the STM application under `localhost:4200`.
Everything should work now and if not, don't hesitate to raise an issue :)

# Run server

After these variables are visible, start the server:

* `cd server`
* `go run .`

The server starts under port `8080` and has an info page to check if it's running: [localhost:8080/info](http://localhost:8080/info)

# Run Tests

**tl;dr:**
* `cd server`
* `./run-tests.sh`

Use the `server/run-tests.sh` script to run tests and provide the database with dummy data (required for the tests).
This script will set up the database `stm_test` in the docker container `stm-db`, fill the database with dummy data and execute the tests.

# Build & Run

## Run the server

**tl;dr:**
* `cd server`
* `go run . -c path/to/your/config.json`

I suggest to use the `config/default.json` file together with the two environment variables `STM_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` and `STM_OAUTH2_SECRET` set.
See [Configuration](#configuration) below for more details.

## Build the server

**tl;dr:**
* `cd server`
* `go build .`

However, I don't use this during development but only during deployment and only within the `Dockerfile`.

# Development

## Error handling

Whenever an error from a library/framework (e.g. in a database store) is returned, wrap it using `errors.Wrap(err)` (from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package) and return that.
This will later result in a nice stack trace when the HTTP response is created.
All other places just return the error because it's already wrapped (and therefore will already produce a stack trace).

New errors should also be created using `errors.New(...)`.

Whenever catching, creating or wrapping an error, feel free to print additional information using `sigolo.Error(...)`. 

## Code conventions

See the [development README](../doc/development/README.md) for details.

# Configuration

There are configuration files in the folder `./server/config/`.
For local development, you don't need to change anything there.
If you still want to change things, just take a look at the properties, they are quite simple and straight forward.

You still need to specify your OAuth2 values (client-ID and secret) and it's recommended to do that via environment variables, e.g. in your IDE setup.
Peek into the [deployment README](../doc/operation/stm.md) for further details.

# HTTPS

The recommended way for a hosted version is to use a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) that handles the SSL certificates.
Take a look at the operation documentation for further information.

## Direct usage of certificates

Even though it's not the recommended way (at least since 1.7.0), one can als directly use SSL certificates.
At least for Let's Encrypt, you only need to set the following properties in your configuration (next to the others of course):

```json
{
	"server-url": "https://your.domain.com",
	"ssl-cert-file": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/fullchain.pem",
	"ssl-key-file": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/privkey.pem",
	...
}
```

**Important:** The `server-url` property has to begin with `https` in order to activate HTTPS.

For **further information**, take a look at the `doc/operation/ssl-cert.md` file.
